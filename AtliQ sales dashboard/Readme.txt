Problem Statement:

AtliQ Hardware, a large hardware company with multiple regional offices across India, is facing a decline in sales. Sales Director Pawan Patel struggles to analyze sales trends due to the inefficiency of traditional methods, like managing large, complex Excel sheets from district managers. These sheets are often inaccurate, delayed, and difficult to interpret, making it challenging to gain actionable insights.

Solution Requirements:

Pawan needs a real-time, visual solution to track key metrics like top products, revenue trends, and regional performance. This solution should replace cumbersome Excel files with an intuitive tool to simplify data analysis and support faster decision-making.

Proposed Approach:

  Planning:

   Pawan will meet with the IT Director and Data Analytics team to define goals and success criteria using the AIMS Grid.

  Data Discovery:

   The Data Analytics team will collaborate with IT to access sales records stored in a MySQL database. Tableau will be connected to pull the required data.

  Visualization:

   Tableau dashboards will present interactive and visual insights, enabling better understanding of sales trends and facilitating quicker, informed decisions.
